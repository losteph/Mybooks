# My Books
All my university note in one place. I'm a Master's student in Cyber-Physical Systems at PoliBa. The majority of these files are written in Italian.

## Disclaimer
I do NOT own most of the Figure used in my class transcribed notes. I make all my work available for free (I don't make profit by using these pictures). These books will be helpful for everyone following the same course. I don't know the sources, I just followed the lessons and put every picture of the class slides.
